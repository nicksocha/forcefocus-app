#### [Forcefocus.app](https://forcefocus.app) is a site I threw together to help keep everyone on track studying for school…

It is a timer that times up and counts down. Press Forward when you're studying and Backward when you're slacking... As long as you study more time in a day than you slack you can call that a productive day of studying…
